# DEMU Jukebox User Guide

**Purpose:** This document provides a step-by-step guide for using the DEMU Jukebox. It's a living document, subject to updates as needed. Your feedback is welcome for any missed steps.

## 1. Accessing the DEMU Jukebox

1. You can access the Jukebox directly by visiting [https://jukebox.demu.pro](https://jukebox.demu.pro).

2. Alternatively, you can go to [https://demu.pro](https://demu.pro) and click the "Buy Music On The Jukebox" button.

## 2. Interacting with the DEMU Jukebox

You need a Cardano wallet to access the site. The wallet is used for purchasing music and storing your music albums.

- **Desktop:** We recommend using the Nami wallet. You can download the wallet from [https://namiwallet.io/](https://namiwallet.io/).
  - Note: Only the Chrome, Brave, and Firefox browsers will support crypto wallets.

- **Mobile:** For mobile users, we highly recommend the VESPR wallet. You can download VESPR from [https://vespr.xyz/#](https://vespr.xyz/#).

Once you've downloaded the wallet and created an account, secure your seed phrase. This phrase is crucial for accessing your account later. Losing the seed phrase could result in losing your funds. With self-custody comes the responsibility to secure this phrase.
